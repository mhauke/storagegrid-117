[.lead]
You can edit a storage pool to change its name or to update sites and storage grades.

.What you'll need
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.
* You  have reviewed the link:guidelines-for-creating-storage-pools.html[guidelines for creating storage pools].
* If you plan to edit a storage pool that is used by a rule in the active ILM policy, you have considered how your changes will affect object data placement.

.About this task
If you are adding a new site or storage grade to a storage pool that is used in the active ILM policy, be aware that the Storage Nodes in the new site or storage grade will not be used automatically. To force StorageGRID to use a new site or storage grade, you must activate a new ILM policy after saving the edited storage pool.

.Steps
. Select *ILM* > *Storage pools*.

. Select the checkbox for the storage pool you want to edit.
+
You can't edit the All Storage Nodes storage pool (StorageGRID 11.6 and earlier).

. Select *Edit*.
. As required, change the storage pool name.
. As required, select other sites and storage grades.
+
NOTE: You are prevented from changing the site or storage grade if the storage pool is used in an erasure coding profile and the change would cause the erasure-coding scheme to become invalid. For example, if a storage pool used in a erasure coding profile currently includes a storage grade with only one site, you are prevented from using a storage grade with two sites because the change would make the erasure-coding scheme invalid.

. Select *Save*.

.After you finish
If you added a new site or storage grade to a storage pool used in the active ILM policy, activate a new ILM policy to force StorageGRID to use the new site or storage grade. For example, clone your existing ILM policy and then activate the clone. See link:working-with-ilm-rules-and-ilm-policies.html[Work with ILM rules and ILM policies].
