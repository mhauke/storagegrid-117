You can edit a Cloud Storage Pool to change its name, service endpoint, or other details; however, you can't change the S3 bucket or Azure container for a Cloud Storage Pool.

.Before you begin
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.
* You have reviewed the link:considerations-for-cloud-storage-pools.html[considerations for Cloud Storage Pools].

.Steps
. Select *ILM* > *Storage pools* > *Cloud Storage Pools*.
+
The Cloud Storage Pools table lists the existing Cloud Storage Pools.

. Select the checkbox for the Cloud Storage Pool you want to edit.
. Select *Actions* > *Edit*.
. As required, change the display name, service endpoint, authentication credentials, or certificate validation method.
+
IMPORTANT: You can't change the provider type or the S3 bucket or Azure container for a Cloud Storage Pool.
+
If you previously uploaded a server or client certificate, you can select *Certificate details* to review the certificate that is currently in use.

. Select *Save*.
+
When you save a Cloud Storage Pool, StorageGRID validates that the bucket or container and the service endpoint exist, and that they can be reached using the credentials that you specified.
+
If Cloud Storage Pool validation fails, an error message is displayed. For example, an error might be reported if there is a certificate error.
+
See the instructions for link:troubleshooting-cloud-storage-pools.html[troubleshooting Cloud Storage Pools], resolve the issue, and then try saving the Cloud Storage Pool again.
