[.lead]
A Cloud Storage Pool specifies a single external Amazon S3 bucket or other S3-compatible provider, or Azure Blob storage container. 

When you create a Cloud Storage Pool, you specify the name and location of the external bucket or container that StorageGRID will use to store objects, the cloud provider type (Amazon S3/GCP or Azure Blob storage), and the information StorageGRID needs to access the external bucket or container.

StorageGRID validates the Cloud Storage Pool as soon as you save it, so you must ensure that the bucket or container specified in the Cloud Storage Pool exists and is reachable.

.What you'll need
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[required access permissions].
* You have reviewed the link:considerations-for-cloud-storage-pools.html[considerations for Cloud Storage Pools].
* The external bucket or container referenced by the Cloud Storage Pool already exists, and you know its name and location.
* To access the bucket or container, you have the following information for the authentication type you will choose:
+
[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.S3 access key
--
_For the external S3 bucket_

* The access key ID for the account that owns the external bucket.
* The associated secret access key.

Alternatively, you can specify Anonymous for the authentication type. 
--
//end Access key, begin CAP

.C2S access portal
--
_For Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) S3 service_

You have the following:

* Complete URL that StorageGRID will use to obtain temporary credentials from the C2S access portal (CAP) server, including all the required and optional API parameters assigned to your C2S account.
* Server CA certificate issued by an appropriate Government Certificate Authority (CA). StorageGRID uses this certificate to verify the identity of the CAP server. The server CA certificate must use PEM encoding.
* Client certificate issued by an appropriate Government Certificate Authority (CA). StorageGRID uses this certificate to identity itself to the CAP server. The client certificate must use PEM encoding and must have been granted access to your C2S account.
* PEM-encoded private key for the client certificate.
* Passphrase for decrypting the private key for the client certificate, if it is encrypted.

NOTE: If the client certificate will be encrypted, use the traditional format for the encryption. PKCS #8 encrypted format is not supported.
--
//end C2S, begin Azure

.Azure Blob storage
--
_For the external container_

* Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) used to access the Blob Storage container.
* Name of the storage account and the account key. You can use the Azure portal to find these values.

//what you'll need - end tabbed blocks

.Steps
. Select *ILM* > *Storage pools* > *Cloud Storage Pools*.

. Select *Create*, then enter the following information:
+
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Field| Description

|Cloud Storage Pool name
|A name that briefly describes the Cloud Storage Pool and its purpose. Use a name that will be easy to identify when you configure ILM rules.

|Provider type
|Which cloud provider you will use for this Cloud Storage Pool:

* *Amazon S3/GCP*: Select this option for an Amazon S3, Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) S3, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or other S3-compatible provider. 
* *Azure Blob Storage*

|Bucket or container
|The name of the external S3 bucket or Azure container. You can't change this value after the Cloud Storage Pool is saved.
|===

. Based on your Provider type selection, enter the Service endpoint information.
//Service endpoint - tabbed blocks start here
+
[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Amazon S3/GCP
--

.. For the protocol, select either HTTPS or HTTP.
+
NOTE: Don't use HTTP connections for sensitive data.
+
.. Enter the hostname. Example:
+
`s3-_aws-region_.amazonaws.com`
+
.. Select the URL style:
+
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Option| Description

|Auto-detect
|Attempt to automatically detect which URL style to use, based on the information provided. For example, if you specify an IP address, StorageGRID will use a path-style URL. Select this option only if you don't know which specific style to use.

|Virtual-hosted-style
|Use a virtual-hosted-style URL to access the bucket. Virtual-hosted-style URLs include the bucket name as part of the domain name. Example: `+https://bucket-name.s3.company.com/key-name+`

|Path-style
|Use a path-style URL to access the bucket. Path-style URLs include the bucket name at the end. Example: `+https://s3.company.com/bucket-name/key-name+`

*Note:* The path-style URL option is not recommended and will be deprecated in a future release of StorageGRID.
|===
+
.. Optionally, enter the port number, or use the default port: 443 for HTTPS or 80 for HTTP.
--
//Service endpoint - end Amazon S3, begin Azure

.Azure Blob Storage
--
.. Using one of the following formats, enter the URI for the service endpoint.

* `+https://host:port+`
* `+http://host:port+`

Example: `https://_myaccount_.blob.core.windows.net:443`

If you don't specify a port, by default port 443 is used for HTTPS and port 80 is used for HTTP.
====
//Service endpoint - end tabbed blocks

[start=4]
. Select *Continue*. Then select the authentication type and enter the required information for the Cloud Storage Pool endpoint:
+
//Authentication type - tabbed blocks start here
+
[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.Access key
--
_For Amazon S3/GCP provider type only_

.. For *Access key ID*, enter the access key ID for the account that owns the external bucket.
.. For *Secret access key*, enter the secret access key.

--
//Authentication type - end Access key, begin CAP

.CAP (C2S access portal)
--
_For Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) S3 service_

.. For *Temporary credentials URL*, enter the complete URL that StorageGRID will use to obtain temporary credentials from the CAP server, including all the required and optional API parameters assigned to your C2S account.
.. For *Server CA certificate*, select *Browse*, and upload the PEM-encoded CA certificate that StorageGRID will use to verify the CAP server.
.. For *Client certificate*, select *Browse*, and upload the PEM-encoded certificate that StorageGRID will use to identify itself to the CAP server.
.. For *Client private key*, select *Browse*, and upload the PEM-encoded private key for the client certificate.
.. If the client private key is encrypted, enter the passphrase for decrypting the client private key. Otherwise, leave the *Client private key passphrase* field blank.

--
//Authentication type - end C2S, begin Azure
.Azure Blob Storage
--
.. For *Account name*, enter the name of the Blob storage account that owns the external service container.
.. For *Account key*, enter the secret key for the Blob storage account.

--
//Authentication type - end Azure, begin Anonymous

.Anonymous
--
No additional information is required.
====
//Authentication type - end tabbed blocks

. Select *Continue*. Then choose the type of server verification you want to use:
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
|Option |Description

|Use root CA certificates in Storage Node OS
|Use the Grid CA certificates installed on the operating system to secure connections.

|Use custom CA certificate
|Use a custom CA certificate. Select *Browse*, and upload the PEM-encoded certificate.

|Do not verify certificate
|The certificate used for the TLS connection is not verified.
|===
+
. Select *Save*.
+
When you save a Cloud Storage Pool, StorageGRID does the following:

* Validates that the bucket or container and the service endpoint exist and that they can be reached using the credentials that you specified.
* Writes a marker file to the bucket or container to identify it as a Cloud Storage Pool. Never remove this file, which is named `x-ntap-sgws-cloud-pool-uuid`.
+
If Cloud Storage Pool validation fails, you receive an error message that explains why validation failed. For example, an error might be reported if there is a certificate error or if the bucket or container you specified does not already exist.

. If an error occurs, see the link:troubleshooting-cloud-storage-pools.html[instructions for troubleshooting Cloud Storage Pools], resolve any issues, and then try saving the Cloud Storage Pool again.
