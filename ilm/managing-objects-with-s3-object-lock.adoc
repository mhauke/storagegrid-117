== Comparing S3 Object Lock to legacy Compliance

The S3 Object Lock replaces the Compliance feature that was available in earlier StorageGRID versions. Because the  S3 Object Lock feature conforms to Amazon S3 requirements, it deprecates the proprietary StorageGRID Compliance feature, which is now referred to as "`legacy Compliance.`"

NOTE: The global Compliance setting is deprecated. If you enabled this setting using a previous version of StorageGRID, the S3 Object Lock setting is enabled automatically. You can continue to use StorageGRID to manage the settings of existing compliant buckets; however, you can't create new compliant buckets. For details, see https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Hybrid_Cloud_Infrastructure/StorageGRID/How_to_manage_legacy_Compliant_buckets_in_StorageGRID_11.5[NetApp Knowledge Base: How to manage legacy Compliant buckets in StorageGRID 11.5^].

If you used the legacy Compliance feature in a previous version of StorageGRID, refer to the following table to learn how it compares to the S3 Object Lock feature in StorageGRID.
