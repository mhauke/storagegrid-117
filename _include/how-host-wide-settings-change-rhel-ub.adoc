//rhel and ub, "How host-wide settings change during installation"
The following changes are made:

----
# Recommended Cassandra setting: CASSANDRA-3563, CASSANDRA-13008, DataStax documentation
vm.max_map_count = 1048575

# core file customization
# Note: for cores generated by binaries running inside containers, this
# path is interpreted relative to the container filesystem namespace.
# External cores will go nowhere, unless /var/local/core also exists on
# the host.
kernel.core_pattern = /var/local/core/%e.core.%p

# Set the kernel minimum free memory to the greater of the current value or
# 512MiB if the host has 48GiB or less of RAM or 1.83GiB if the host has more than 48GiB of RTAM
vm.min_free_kbytes = 524288

# Enforce current default swappiness value to ensure the VM system has some
# flexibility to garbage collect behind anonymous mappings. Bump watermark_scale_factor
# to help avoid OOM conditions in the kernel during memory allocation bursts. Bump
# dirty_ratio to 90 because we explicitly fsync data that needs to be persistent, and
# so do not require the dirty_ratio safety net. A low dirty_ratio combined with a large
# working set (nr_active_pages) can cause us to enter synchronous I/O mode unnecessarily,
# with deleterious effects on performance.
