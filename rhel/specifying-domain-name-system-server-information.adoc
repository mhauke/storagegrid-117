You must specify domain name system (DNS) information for your StorageGRID system, so that you can access external servers using hostnames instead of IP addresses.

.About this task

Specifying link:../commonhardware/checking-dns-server-configuration.html[DNS server information] allows you to use Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) hostnames rather than IP addresses for email notifications and AutoSupport.

include::../_include/dns-server-restrictions.adoc[]

If the DNS server information is omitted or incorrectly configured, a DNST alarm is triggered on each grid node's SSM service. The alarm clears when DNS is configured correctly and the new server information has reached all grid nodes.

.Steps

. Specify the IPv4 address for at least one DNS server in the *Server 1* text box.
. If necessary, select the plus sign next to the last entry to add additional server entries.
