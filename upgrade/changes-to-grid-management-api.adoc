StorageGRID 11.7 uses version 3 of the Grid Management API. Version 3 deprecates version 2; however, version 1 and version 2 are still supported.

IMPORTANT: You can continue to use version 1 and version 2 of the management API with StorageGRID 11.7; however, support for these versions of the API will be removed in a future release of StorageGRID. After upgrading to StorageGRID 11.7, the deprecated v1 and v2 APIs can be deactivated using the `PUT /grid/config/management` API.
