If your tenant account was assigned the *Use grid federation connection* permission when it was created, you can use cross-grid replication to automatically replicate objects between buckets on the tenant's source grid and buckets on the tenant's destination grid. Cross-grid replication can occur in one or both directions.

== Workflow for cross-grid replication

The workflow diagram summarize the steps you will perform to configure cross-grid replication between buckets on two grids. These steps are described in more detail below.

== Configure cross-grid replication

Before you can use cross-grid replication, you must sign in to the corresponding tenant accounts on each grid and create identical buckets. Then, you can enable cross-grid replication on either or both buckets.

.What you'll need

* You have reviewed the requirements for cross-grid replication. See link:../admin/grid-federation-what-is-cross-grid-replication.html[What is cross-grid replication].
* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* The tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission, and identical tenant accounts exist on both grids. See xref:../admin/grid-federation-manage-tenants.adoc[Manage the permitted tenants for grid federation connection].
* The tenant user you will be signing in as already exists on both grids and belongs to a user group that has the xref:tenant-management-permissions.adoc[Root access permission].
* If you will be signing in to the tenant's destination grid as a local user, the root user for the tenant account has set a password for your user account on that grid .

=== Create two identical buckets

. Starting from either grid in the grid federation connection, create a new bucket:

.. Sign in to the tenant account using the credentials of a tenant user who exists on both grids.
+
NOTE: If you are unable to sign in to the tenant's destination grid as a local user, confirm that the root user for the tenant account has set a password for your user account.

.. Follow the instructions to xref:creating-s3-bucket.adoc[create an S3 bucket].
.. On the *Manage object settings* tab, select *Enable object versioning*.
.. If S3 Object Lock is enabled for your StorageGRID system, do not enable S3 Object Lock for the bucket. 
.. Select *Create bucket*.
.. Select *Finish*.

. Repeat these steps to create an identical bucket for the same tenant account on the other grid in the grid federation connection. 

=== Enable cross-grid replication

You must perform these steps before adding any objects to either bucket.

. Starting from a grid whose objects you want to replicate, enable link:../admin/grid-federation-what-is-cross-grid-replication.html[cross-grid replication in one direction]:

.. Sign in to the tenant account for the bucket.

.. Select *View buckets* from the dashboard, or select  *STORAGE (S3)* > *Buckets*.

.. Select the bucket name from the table to access the bucket details page.

.. Select the *Cross-grid replication* tab.

.. Select *Enable*, and review the list of requirements.

.. If all requirements have been met, select the grid federation connection you want to use.

.. Optionally, change the setting of *Replicate client deletes* to determine what happens on the destination grid if an S3 client issues a delete request to the source grid that doesn't include a version ID:

* If *Yes* (default), a delete marker is added to the source bucket and replicated to the destination bucket.

* If *No*, a delete marker is added to the source bucket but is not replicated to the destination bucket. 
+

+
NOTE: If the delete request includes a version ID, that object version is permanently removed from the source bucket. StorageGRID does not replicate delete requests that include a version ID, so the same object version is not deleted from the destination.
+
See link:../admin/grid-federation-what-is-cross-grid-replication.html[What is cross-grid replication] for details.


.. Review your selections. You won't be able to change these settings unless both buckets are empty.

.. Select *Enable and test*.
+
After a few moments, a success message appears. Objects added to this bucket will now be automatically replicated to the other grid. *Cross-grid replication* is shown as an enabled feature on the bucket details page.

. Optionally, go to the corresponding bucket on the other grid and link:../admin/grid-federation-what-is-cross-grid-replication.html[enable cross-grid replication in both directions].

== Test replication between grids

If cross-grid replication is enabled for a bucket, you might need to verify that the connection and cross-grid replication are working correctly and that the source and destination buckets still meet all requirements (for example, versioning is still enabled). 

.What you'll need

* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the xref:tenant-management-permissions.adoc[Root access permission].

.Steps

. Sign in to the tenant account for the bucket.

. Select *View buckets* from the dashboard, or select  *STORAGE (S3)* > *Buckets*.

. Select the bucket name from the table to access the bucket details page.

. Select the *Cross-grid replication* tab.

. Select *Test connection*.
+
If the connection is healthy, a success banner appears. Otherwise, an error message appears, which you and the grid admin can use to resolve the issue. For details, see link:../admin/grid-federation-troubleshoot.html[Troubleshoot grid federation errors].

. If cross-grid replication is configured to occur in both directions, go to the corresponding bucket on the other grid and select *Test connection* to verify that cross-grid replication is working in the other direction.

== Disable cross-grid replication

You can permanently stop cross-grid replication if you no longer want to copy objects to the other grid. 

Before disabling cross-grid replication, note the following:

* You cannot reenable replication unless both buckets are empty.

* Disabling cross-grid replication does not remove any objects that have already been copied between grids. For example, objects in `my-bucket` on Grid 1 that have been copied to `my-bucket` on Grid 2 are not removed if you disable cross-grid replication for that bucket. If you want to delete these objects, you must remove them manually.

* If cross-grid replication was enabled for each of the buckets (that is, if replication occurs in both directions), you can disable cross-grid replication for either or both buckets. For example, you might want to disable replicating objects from `my-bucket` on Grid 1 to `my-bucket` on Grid 2, while continuing to replicate objects from `my-bucket` on Grid 2 to `my-bucket` on Grid 1.

* You must disable cross-grid replication before you can remove a tenant's permission to use the grid federation connection. See xref:../admin/grid-federation-manage-tenants.adoc[Manage permitted tenants].

.What you'll need

* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the xref:tenant-management-permissions.adoc[Root access permission].

.Steps

. Starting from the grid whose objects you no longer want to replicate, stop cross-grid replication for the bucket:

.. Sign in to the tenant account for the bucket.

.. Select *View buckets* from the dashboard, or select  *STORAGE (S3)* > *Buckets*.

.. Select the bucket name from the table to access the bucket details page.

.. Select the *Cross-grid replication* tab.

.. Select *Disable replication*.

.. If you are sure you want to disable cross-grid replication for this bucket, type *Yes* in the text box, and select *Disable*.
+
After a few moments, a success message appears. New objects added to this bucket can no longer be automatically replicated to the other grid. *Cross-grid replication* is no longer shown as a Enabled feature on the Buckets page.

. If cross-grid replication was configured to occur in both directions, go to the corresponding bucket on the other grid and stop cross-grid replication in the other direction.
