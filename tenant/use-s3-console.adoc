You can use S3 Console to view the objects in an S3 bucket.

You can also use S3 Console to do the following:

* Add and delete objects, object versions, and folders
* Rename objects
* Move and copy objects between buckets and folders
* Manage object tags
* View object metadata
* Download objects

NOTE: The S3 Console is marked as “experimental” because it is not yet complete or approved for use in a production environment. Tenants should only use S3 Console when performing functions for a small number of objects, such as when uploading objects to simulate a new ILM policy, troubleshooting ingest issues, or using proof-of-concept or non-production grids.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the Root access permission or that has both the Manage all buckets and Manage objects with S3 Console link:tenant-management-permissions.html[permissions].
+
NOTE: Users who have the Manage objects with S3 Console permission but who don't have the Manage all buckets permission can still navigate directly to the Experimental S3 Console.

* You have created a bucket.
* An S3 Group or Bucket policy has been configured for the user.
* You know the user's access key ID and secret access key. Optionally, you have a `.csv` file containing this information. See the link:creating-your-own-s3-access-keys.html[instructions for creating access keys].

.Steps

. Select *Buckets*.
. Select image:../media/s3_console_link.png[S3 Console link]. You can also access this link from the bucket details page.

. Select *Sign in*.
. Manage objects as needed.
