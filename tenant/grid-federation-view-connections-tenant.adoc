If your tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission, you can view the allowed connections.

.What you'll need

* The tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission.
* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the link:tenant-management-permissions.html[Root access permission].

.Steps

. Select *STORAGE (S3)* > *Grid federation connections*.
+
The Grid federation connection page appears, and includes a table that summarizes the following information:

* The *Connection name* column shows the grid federation connections this tenant has permission to use. 

* For each grid federation connection, the *Buckets with cross-grid replication* column lists all tenant buckets that have cross-grid replication enabled. Objects added to these buckets will be replicated to the other grid in the connection.

* For each grid federation connection, the *Last error* column shows the most recent error to occur, if any, when data was being replicated to the other grid. See <<clear-last-error,Clear the last error>>.

. Optionally, select a bucket name to link:viewing-s3-bucket-details.html[view bucket details].

== [[clear-last-error]]Clear the last error

An error might appear in the *Last error* column for one of these reasons:

* The source object version was not found.
* The source bucket was not found.
* The destination bucket was deleted.
* The destination bucket was re-created by a different account.	
* The destination bucket has versioning suspended.
* The destination bucket was re-created by the same account but is now unversioned.

NOTE: This column only shows the last cross-grid replication error to occur; previous errors that might have occurred will not be shown.

If a message appears in the *Last error* column:

. Review the message text.
+
For example, this error indicates that the destination bucket for cross-grid replication was in an invalid state, possibly because versioning was suspended or S3 Object Lock was enabled.
+

. Perform any recommended actions. For example, if versioning was suspended on the destination bucket for cross-grid replication, reenable versioning for that bucket.

. Select the connection from the table.
. Select *Clear error*.
. Select *Yes* to clear the message and update the system's status.
. Wait 5-6 minutes and then ingest a new object into the bucket. Confirm that the error message does not reappear.
+
NOTE: To ensure the error message is cleared, wait at least 5 minutes after the timestamp in the message before ingesting a new object.
+
TIP: After you clear the error, a new *Last error* might appear if objects are ingested in a different bucket that also has an error. 

. To determine if any objects failed to be replicated because of the bucket error, see link:../admin/grid-federation-retry-failed-replication.html[Identify and retry failed replication operations].
