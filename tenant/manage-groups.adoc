[.lead]
You can view a group; edit a group’s name, permissions, policies, and users; duplicate a group; or delete a group.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the link:tenant-management-permissions.html[Root access permission].

== View or edit group

You can view and edit the basic information and details for each group.

.Steps

. Select *ACCESS MANAGEMENT* > *Groups*.

. Review the information provided on the Groups page, which lists basic information for all local and federated groups for this tenant account.
+
If the tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission and you are viewing groups on the tenant's source grid, a blue banner indicates that if you edit or remove a group, your changes will not be synced to the other grid. See link:grid-federation-account-clone.html[Clone tenant groups and users].

. If you want to change the group's name:

.. Select the check box for the group.
.. Select  *Actions* > *Edit group name*.
.. Enter the new name.
.. Select *Save changes.*

. If you want to view more details or make additional edits, do either of the following:

** Select the group name.

** Select the check box for the group, and select *Actions* > *View group details*.

. Review the Overview section, which shows the following information for each group:

** Display name
** Unique name
** Type
** Access mode
** Permissions
** S3 Policy
** Number of users in this group
** Additional fields if the tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission and you are viewing the group on the tenant's source grid:

*** Cloning status, either *Success* or *Failure*

*** A blue banner indicating that if you edit or delete this group, your changes will not be synced to the other grid.

. Edit group settings as needed. See link:creating-groups-for-s3-tenant.html[Create groups for an S3 tenant] and link:creating-groups-for-swift-tenant.html[Create groups for a Swift tenant] for details about what to enter.

.. In the Overview section, change the display name by selecting the name or the edit icon image:../media/icon_edit_tm.png[Edit icon].

.. On the *Group permissions* tab, update the permissions, and select *Save changes*.

.. On the *Group policy* tab, make any changes, and select *Save changes*.

*** If you are editing an S3 group, optionally select a different S3 group policy or enter the JSON string for a custom policy, as required.

*** If you are editing a Swift group, optionally select or unselect the *Swift Administrator* check box.

.. On the *Users* tab, add or remove local users.

. Confirm that you selected *Save changes* for each section you changed.

== Duplicate group

You can duplicate an existing group to create new groups more quickly.

NOTE: If your tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission and you duplicate a group from the tenant's source grid, the duplicated group will be cloned to the tenant's destination grid.

.Steps

. Select *ACCESS MANAGEMENT* > *Groups*.

. Select the check box for the group you want to duplicate.

. Select *Actions* > *Duplicate group*.

. See link:creating-groups-for-s3-tenant.html[Create groups for an S3 tenant] or link:creating-groups-for-swift-tenant.html[Create groups for a Swift tenant] for details about what to enter.

. Select *Create group*.

== Delete one or more groups

You can delete one or more groups. Any users who belong only to a group that is deleted will no longer be able to sign in to the Tenant Manager or use the tenant account.

NOTE: If your tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission and you delete a group, StorageGRID will not delete the corresponding group on the other grid. If you need to keep this information in sync, you must delete the same group from both grids.

.Steps

. Select *ACCESS MANAGEMENT* > *Groups*.

. Select the check box for each group you want to delete.

. Select *Actions* > *Delete group* or *Actions* > *Delete groups*.
+
A confirmation dialog box appears.

. Select *Delete group* or *Delete groups*.
