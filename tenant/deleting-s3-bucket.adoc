You can use the Tenant Manager to delete one or more S3 buckets that are empty.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the link:tenant-management-permissions.html[Manage all buckets or Root access permission]. These permissions override the permissions settings in group or bucket policies.
* The buckets you want to delete are empty.
