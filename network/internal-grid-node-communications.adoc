[.lead]
The StorageGRID internal firewall allows incoming connections to specific ports on the Grid Network. Connections are also accepted on ports defined by load balancer endpoints. 

NOTE: NetApp recommends that you enable Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic between grid nodes. Allowing ICMP traffic can improve failover performance when a grid node cannot be reached.

In addition to ICMP and the ports listed in the table, StorageGRID uses the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). VRRP is an internet protocol that uses IP protocol number 112. StorageGRID uses VRRP in unicast mode only. VRRP is required only if link:../admin/managing-high-availability-groups.html[high availability groups] are configured.

== Guidelines for Linux-based nodes

If enterprise networking policies restrict access to any of these ports, you can remap ports at deployment time using a deployment configuration parameter. For more information about port remapping and deployment configuration parameters, see:

* link:../rhel/index.html[Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS]
* link:../ubuntu/index.html[Install Ubuntu or Debian]

== Guidelines for VMware-based nodes

Configure the following ports only if you need to define firewall restrictions that are external to VMware networking.

If enterprise networking policies restrict access to any of these ports, you can remap ports when you deploy nodes using the VMware vSphere Web Client, or by using a configuration file setting when automating grid node deployment. For more information about port remapping and deployment configuration parameters, see 
link:../vmware/index.html[Install VMware].

== Guidelines for appliance nodes

If enterprise networking policies restrict access to any of these ports, you can remap ports using the StorageGRID Appliance Installer. For more information about port remapping for appliances, see:

* link:../sg100-1000/index.html[SG100 and SG1000 services appliances]
* link:../sg6100/index.html[SGF6112 storage appliances]
