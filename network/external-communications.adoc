[.lead]
Clients need to communicate with grid nodes to ingest and retrieve content. The ports used depends on the object storage protocols chosen. These ports need to be accessible to the client.

== Restricted access to ports

If enterprise networking policies restrict access to any of the ports, you can use link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[load balancer endpoints] to allow access on user-defined ports. You can then use link:../admin/manage-firewall-controls.html[untrusted Client Networks] to allow access only on load balancer endpoint ports.

== Port remapping

To use systems and protocols such as SMTP, DNS, SSH, or DHCP, you must remap ports when deploying nodes. However, you should not remap load balancer endpoints. For information about port remapping, see the installation instructions for your platform:

.Software-based nodes

* link:../rhel/index.html[Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS]

* link:../ubuntu/index.html[Install Ubuntu or Debian]

* link:../vmware/index.html[Install VMware]

.Appliance nodes

* link:../sg100-1000/index.html[SG100 and SG1000 services appliances]

* link:../sg6000/index.html[SG6000 storage appliances]

* link:../sg5700/index.html[SG5700 storage appliances]

* link:../sg5600/index.html[SG5600 storage appliances]

== Ports used for external communications

The following table shows the ports used for traffic into the nodes.

NOTE: This list does not include ports that might be configured as link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[load balancer endpoints].
