[.lead]
You can use the S3 HEAD Object request to retrieve metadata from an object without returning the object itself. If the object is stored in a Cloud Storage Pool, you can use HEAD Object to determine the object's transition state.

== HEAD object and multipart objects

You can use the `partNumber` request parameter to retrieve metadata for a specific part of a multipart or segmented object.  The `x-amz-mp-parts-count` response element indicates how many parts the object has.

You can set `partNumber` to 1 for both segmented/multipart objects and  non-segmented/non-multipart objects; however, the `x-amz-mp-parts-count` response element is only returned for segmented or multipart objects.

== UTF-8 characters in user metadata

StorageGRID does not parse or interpret escaped UTF-8 characters in user-defined metadata. HEAD requests for an object with escaped UTF-8 characters in user-defined metadata don't return the `x-amz-missing-meta` header if the key name or value includes unprintable characters.

== Unsupported request header

The following request header is not supported and returns `XNotImplemented`:

* `x-amz-website-redirect-location`

== Versioning

If a `versionId` subresource is not specified, the operation fetches the most recent version of the object in a versioned bucket. If the current version of the object is a delete marker, a "`Not Found`" status is returned with the `x-amz-delete-marker` response header set to `true`.

== Request headers for server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)

Use all three of these headers if the object is encrypted with a unique key that you provided.

* `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`: Specify `AES256`.
* `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`: Specify your encryption key for the object.
* `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`: Specify the MD5 digest of the object's encryption key.

IMPORTANT: The encryption keys you provide are never stored. If you lose an encryption key, you lose the corresponding object. Before using customer-provided keys to secure object data, review the considerations in link:using-server-side-encryption.html[Use server-side encryption].

== HEAD Object responses for Cloud Storage Pool objects

If the object is stored in a link:../ilm/what-cloud-storage-pool-is.html[Cloud Storage Pool], the following response headers are returned:

* `x-amz-storage-class: GLACIER`
* `x-amz-restore`

The response headers provide information about the state of an object as it is moved to a Cloud Storage Pool, optionally transitioned to a non-retrievable state, and restored.

[cols="1a,1a" options="header"]
|===
| State of object| Response to HEAD object

| Object ingested into StorageGRID but not yet evaluated by ILM, or object stored in a traditional storage pool or using erasure coding
| `200 OK` (No special response header is returned.)

| Object in Cloud Storage Pool but not yet transitioned to a non-retrievable state
|`200 OK`

`x-amz-storage-class: GLACIER`

`x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Sat, 23 July 20 2030 00:00:00 GMT"`

Until the object is transitioned to a non-retrievable state, the value for `expiry-date` is set to some distant time in the future. The exact time of transition is not controlled by the StorageGRID system.

| Object has transitioned to non-retrievable state, but at least one copy also exists on the grid
| `200 OK`

`x-amz-storage-class: GLACIER`

`x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Sat, 23 July 20 2030 00:00:00 GMT"`

The value for `expiry-date` is set to some distant time in the future.

*Note*: If the copy on the grid is not available (for example, a Storage Node is down), you must issue a link:post-object-restore.html[POST Object restore] request to restore the copy from the Cloud Storage Pool before you can successfully retrieve the object.

| Object transitioned to a non-retrievable state, and no copy exists on the grid
| `200 OK`

`x-amz-storage-class: GLACIER`

| Object in process of being restored from a non-retrievable state
| `200 OK`

`x-amz-storage-class: GLACIER`

`x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="true"`

| Object fully restored to the Cloud Storage Pool
| `200 OK`

`x-amz-storage-class: GLACIER`

`x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Sat, 23 July 20 2018 00:00:00 GMT"`

The `expiry-date` indicates when the object in the Cloud Storage Pool will be returned to a non-retrievable state.

|===

=== Multipart or segmented objects in Cloud Storage Pool

If you uploaded a multipart object or if StorageGRID split a large object into segments, StorageGRID determines whether the object is available in the Cloud Storage Pool by sampling a subset of the object's parts or segments. In some cases, a HEAD Object request might incorrectly return `x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false"` when some parts of the object have already been transitioned to a non-retrievable state or when some parts of the object have not yet been restored.

== HEAD Object and cross-grid replication
If you are using link:../admin/grid-federation-overview.html[grid federation] and link:../tenant/grid-federation-manage-cross-grid-replication.html[cross-grid replication] is enabled for a bucket, the S3 client can verify an object's replication status by issuing a HEAD Object request. The response includes the StorageGRID-specific `x-ntap-sg-cgr-replication-status` response header, which will have one of the following values:

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Grid| Replication status 

| Source
| * *SUCCESS*: The replication was successful.
* *PENDING*: The object hasn't been replicated yet.
* *FAILURE*: The replication failed with a permanent failure. A user must resolve the error.

| Destination
| *REPLICA*: The object was replicated from the source grid.

|===

NOTE: StorageGRID does not support the `x-amz-replication-status` header.
