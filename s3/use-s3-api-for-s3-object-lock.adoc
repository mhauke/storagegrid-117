If the global S3 Object Lock setting is enabled for your StorageGRID system, you can create buckets with S3 Object Lock enabled. You can then specify default retention settings for each bucket or each object version you add to that bucket. If an object version uses governance mode, users with special permissions can bypass its retention settings.

== How to enable S3 Object Lock for a bucket

If the global S3 Object Lock setting is enabled for your StorageGRID system, you can optionally enable S3 Object Lock when you create each bucket. 

S3 Object Lock is a permanent setting that can only be enabled when you create a bucket. You cannot add or disable S3 Object Lock after a bucket is created.

To enable S3 Object Lock for a bucket, use either of these methods:

* Create the bucket using the Tenant Manager. See xref:../tenant/creating-s3-bucket.adoc[Create S3 bucket].

* Create the bucket using a PUT Bucket request with the `x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled` request header. See xref:operations-on-buckets.adoc[Operations on buckets].

S3 Object Lock requires bucket versioning, which is enabled automatically when the bucket is created. You cannot suspend versioning for the bucket. See xref:object-versioning.adoc[Object versioning].

== Default retention settings for a bucket

After you enable S3 Object Lock for a bucket, you can optionally enable default retention for the bucket and specify the default retention mode and default retention period.

=== Default retention mode

* In COMPLIANCE mode:

** The object cannot be deleted until its retain-until-date is reached. 
** The object's retain-until-date can be increased, but it cannot be decreased.
** The object's retain-until-date cannot be removed until that date is reached.  

* In GOVERNANCE mode:

** Users with special permission can use a bypass header in requests to modify certain retention settings. 
** These users can delete an object version before its retain-until-date is reached.
** These users can increase, decrease, or remove an object's retain-until-date.

=== Default retention period

Each bucket can have a default retention period in years or days. 

== How to set default retention for a bucket

To set the default retention for a bucket, use either of these methods:

* Manage bucket settings from the Tenant Manager. See xref:../tenant/configure-s3-object-lock-settings-for-bucket.adoc[Configure S3 Object Lock settings for a bucket]. 
* Issue a PUT Object Lock Configuration request for the bucket to specify the default mode and default number of days or years. 


=== PUT Object Lock Configuration

The PUT Object Lock Configuration request allows you to set and  modify the default retention mode and default retention period for a bucket that has S3 Object Lock enabled. You can also remove previously configured default retention settings.

When new object versions are ingested to the bucket, the default retention mode is applied if `x-amz-object-lock-mode` and `x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date` are not specified. The default retention period is used to calculate the retain-until-date if `x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date` is not specified.

If the default retention period is modified after ingest of an object version, the retain-until-date of the object version remains the same and is not recalculated using the new default retention period.

You must have the `s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration` permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

The `Content-MD5` request header must be specified in the PUT request.


==== Request example
This example enables S3 Object Lock for a bucket and sets the default retention mode to COMPLIANCE and the default retention period to 6 years.

== How to determine the default retention for a bucket

To determine if S3 Object Lock is enabled for a bucket and to see the default retention mode and retention period, use either of these methods:

* View the bucket in the Tenant Manager. See xref:../tenant/viewing-s3-bucket.adoc[View and manage S3 buckets].
* Issue a GET Object Lock Configuration request.

=== GET Object Lock Configuration

The GET Object Lock Configuration request allows you to determine if S3 Object Lock is enabled for a bucket and, if it is enabled, see if there is a default retention mode and retention period configured for the bucket.

When new object versions are ingested to the bucket, the default retention mode is applied if `x-amz-object-lock-mode` is not specified. The default retention period is used to calculate the retain-until-date if `x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date` is not specified.

You must have the `s3:GetBucketObjectLockConfiguration` permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

== How to specify retention settings for an object

A bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled can contain a combination of objects with and without S3 Object Lock retention settings. 

Object-level retention settings are specified using the S3 REST API. The retention settings for an object override any default retention settings for the bucket. 

You can specify the following settings for each object:

* *Retention mode*: Either COMPLIANCE or GOVERNANCE.

* *Retain-until-date*: A date specifying how long the object version must be retained by StorageGRID.

** In COMPLIANCE mode, if the retain-until-date is in the future, the object can be retrieved, but it cannot be modified or deleted. The retain-until-date can be increased, but this date cannot be decreased or removed.

** In GOVERNANCE mode, users with special permission can bypass the retain-until-date setting. They can delete an object version before its retention period has elapsed. They can also increase, decrease, or even remove the retain-until-date. 

* *Legal hold*: Applying a legal hold to an object version immediately locks that object. For example, you might need to put a legal hold on an object that is related to an investigation or legal dispute. A legal hold has no expiration date, but remains in place until it is explicitly removed. 
+
The legal hold setting for an object is independent of the retention mode and the retain-until-date. If an object version is under a legal hold, no one can delete that version.


To specify S3 Object Lock settings when adding an object version to a bucket, issue a xref:put-object.adoc[PUT Object], xref:put-object-copy.adoc[PUT Object - Copy], or xref:initiate-multipart-upload.adoc[Initiate Multipart Upload] request. 


You can use the following:

* `x-amz-object-lock-mode`, which can be COMPLIANCE or GOVERNANCE (case sensitive).
+
NOTE: If you specify `x-amz-object-lock-mode`, you must also specify `x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date`.

* `x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date`

** The retain-until-date value must be in the format `2020-08-10T21:46:00Z`. Fractional seconds are allowed, but only 3 decimal digits are preserved (milliseconds precision). Other ISO 8601 formats are not allowed.
** The retain-until-date must be in the future.

* `x-amz-object-lock-legal-hold`
+
If legal hold is ON (case-sensitive), the object is placed under a legal hold. If legal hold is OFF, no legal hold is placed. Any other value results in a 400 Bad Request (InvalidArgument) error.

If you use any of these request headers, be aware of these restrictions:

* The `Content-MD5` request header is required if any `x-amz-object-lock-*` request header is present in the PUT Object request. `Content-MD5` is not required for PUT Object - Copy or Initiate Multipart Upload.
* If the bucket does not have S3 Object Lock enabled and a `x-amz-object-lock-*` request header is present, a 400 Bad Request (InvalidRequest) error is returned.
* The PUT Object request supports the use of `x-amz-storage-class: REDUCED_REDUNDANCY` to match AWS behavior. However, when an object is ingested into a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, StorageGRID will always perform a dual-commit ingest.
* A subsequent GET or HEAD Object version response will include the headers `x-amz-object-lock-mode`, `x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date`, and `x-amz-object-lock-legal-hold`, if configured and if the request sender has the correct `s3:Get*` permissions.

* If the mode is COMPLIANCE, a subsequent DELETE Object or DELETE Multiple Objects request will fail if it is before the retain-until-date or if a legal hold is on.
* If the retention mode is GOVERNANCE, users with special permissions can issue DELETE Objects or DELETE Multiple Objects requests after the retain-until-date.

You can use the `s3:object-lock-remaining-retention-days` policy condition key to limit the minimum and maximum allowable retention periods for your objects.

== How to update retention settings for an object

If you need to update the legal hold or retention settings for an existing object version, you can perform the following object subresource operations:

* `PUT Object legal-hold`
+
If the new legal-hold value is ON, the object is placed under a legal hold. If the legal-hold value is OFF, the legal hold is lifted.

* `PUT Object retention`
** The mode value can be COMPLIANCE or GOVERNANCE (case sensitive).
** The retain-until-date value must be in the format `2020-08-10T21:46:00Z`. Fractional seconds are allowed, but only 3 decimal digits are preserved (milliseconds precision). Other ISO 8601 formats are not allowed.
** If an object version has an existing retain-until-date, you can only increase it. The new value must be in the future.

== How to use GOVERNANCE mode

If an object's retention mode is GOVERNANCE, users with special permissions can perform these additional operations:

* Perform DELETE Object or DELETE Multiple Objects operations to delete an object version before its retention period has elapsed.
+
Objects that are under a legal hold cannot be deleted. Legal hold must be OFF. 

* Perform PUT Object retention operations that change an object version's mode from GOVERNANCE to COMPLIANCE before the object's retention period has elapsed.
+
Changing the mode from COMPLIANCE to GOVERNANCE is never allowed.


* Perform PUT Object operations to increase, decrease, or remove an object version's retention period.

To bypass the active retention settings of an object that uses GOVERNANCE mode, any DELETE or PUT Object retention operations must include the `x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true` request header, and the user must have the `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission.
