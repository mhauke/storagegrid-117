// To automatically update all alert summaries for _this_ file during or at the end of a release cycle:
// 1. Go to a build server in the VED/BigTop (http://vtcsgbuild.vtc.eng.netapp.com/output/storagegrid/ or http://rtpsgbuild.rtp.netapp.com/output/storagegrid/).
// 2. On the Build Output Status page that appears, select one of the build servers in the left panel in the section, Build Server Output.
// 3. Select storagegrid/ from the Index of /output/ page.
// 4. Select Ctrl+F to search the page for "adoc" (the entire file name is alert-rules-adoc-format.txt). If a build is in progress, you might have to wait a few seconds or minutes.
// 5. When you locate the .txt file (alert-rules-adoc-format.txt), select the file name to open the file.
// 6. When the file opens, copy the contents and paste over the similar contents in alerts-reference.adoc.
