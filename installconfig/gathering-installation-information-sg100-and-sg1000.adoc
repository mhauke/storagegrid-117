[.lead]
Using the tables, record the required information for each network you connect to the appliance. These values are required to install and configure the hardware.

TIP: Instead of using the tables, use the workbook provided with ConfigBuilder. Using the ConfigBuilder workbook allows you to upload your system information and generate a JSON file to automatically complete some configuration steps in the StorageGRID Appliance Installer. See link:automating-appliance-installation-and-configuration.html[Automate appliance installation and configuration].

== Check StorageGRID version

Before installing an SG100 or SG1000 services appliance, confirm your StorageGRID system is using a required version of StorageGRID software.

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Appliance| Required StorageGRID version
| SG1000
| 11.3 or later (latest hotfix recommended)
| SG100
| 11.4 or later (latest hotfix recommended)
|===

== Administration and maintenance ports

The Admin Network for StorageGRID is an optional network, used for system administration and maintenance. The appliance connects to the Admin Network using the following 1-GbE management ports on the appliance.

*SG100 RJ-45 ports*

*SG1000 RJ-45 ports*

| Information needed| Your value
|
Admin Network enabled
|
Choose one:

* No
* Yes (default)

|
Network bond mode
|
Choose one:

* Independent (default)
* Active-Backup

|
Switch port for the left port circled in the diagram (default active port for Independent network bond mode)

MAC address for the Admin Network port

*Note:* The MAC address label on the front of the appliance lists the MAC address for the BMC management port. To determine the MAC address for the Admin Network port, add *2* to the hexadecimal number on the label. For example, if the MAC address on the label ends in *09*, the MAC address for the Admin Port would end in *0B*. If the MAC address on the label ends in *(_y_)FF*, the MAC address for the Admin Port would end in *(_y_+1)01*. You can easily make this calculation by opening Calculator in Windows, setting it to Programmer mode, selecting Hex, typing the MAC address, then typing *+ 2 =*.

DHCP-assigned IP address for the Admin Network port, if available after power on

*Note:* You can determine the DHCP-assigned IP address by using the MAC address to look up the assigned IP.

|

* IPv4 address (CIDR):
* Gateway:

|
Static IP address you plan to use for the appliance node on the Admin Network

*Note:* If your network does not have a gateway, specify the same static IPv4 address for the gateway.

* 25 GbE

For the SG1000, choose one of the following:

* Auto (default)
* 10 GbE
* 25 GbE
* 40 GbE
* 100 GbE

*Note:* For the SG1000, 10- and 25-GbE speeds require the use of QSA adapters.
