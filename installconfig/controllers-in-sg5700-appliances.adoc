[.lead]
Both the 12-drive SG5712 and SG5712X and the 60-drive SG5760 and SG5760X models of the StorageGRID appliance include an E5700SG compute controller and an E-Series E2800 storage controller. 

* The SG5712 and SG5760 use a E2800A controller. 
* The SG5712X and the SG5760X use a E2800B controller.

The E2800A and E2800B controllers are identical in specification and function except for the location of the interconnect ports. 

== E5700SG controller

* Operates as the compute server for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is accessed from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E2800 controller and operates as the initiator.

== E2800 storage controller

There are two versions of the E2800 storage controller used in the SG5700 appliances: E2800A and E2800B. The E2800A does not have a HIC, and the E2800B has a four-port HIC. The two controller versions have identical specifications and function except for the location of the interconnect ports. 

The E2800 series storage controller has the following specifications: 

* Operates as the storage controller for the appliance.
* Manages the storage of data on the drives.
* Functions as a standard E-Series controller in simplex mode.
* Includes SANtricity OS Software (controller firmware).
* Includes SANtricity System Manager for monitoring appliance hardware and for managing alerts, the AutoSupport feature, and the Drive Security feature.
* Connects to the E5700SG controller and operates as the target.
