As you install and configure a StorageGRID appliance, you make decisions and gather information about Ethernet switch ports, IP addresses, and port and network bond modes. 

The information you need to install and configure the hardware depends on the appliance type. Refer to the instructions for your appliance to determine which information you need to gather:

* link:gathering-installation-information-sg6000.html[SG6000]
* link:gathering-installation-information-sg5700.html[SG5700]
* link:gathering-installation-information-sg100-and-sg1000.html[SG100 and SG1000]

Alternatively, you can work with your NetApp Professional Services consultant to use the NetApp ConfigBuilder tool to streamline and automate the configuration steps. See link:automating-appliance-installation-and-configuration.html[Automate appliance installation and configuration].
