There are operations added on to the Swift REST API that are specific to StorageGRID system.

== GET container consistency request

link:../s3/consistency-controls.html[Consistency controls] provide a balance between the availability of the objects and the consistency of those objects across different Storage Nodes and sites. The GET container consistency request allows you to determine the consistency level being applied to a particular container.

=== Request

[cols="2a,4a" options="header"]
|===
| Request HTTP Header| Description

m| X-Auth-Token
| Specifies the Swift authentication token for the account to use for the request.

m| x-ntap-sg-consistency
| Specifies the type of request, where `true` = GET container consistency, and `false` = GET container.

m| Host
| The hostname to which the request is directed.
|===

=== Request example

----
GET /v1/28544923908243208806/Swift container
X-Auth-Token: SGRD_3a877009a2d24cb1801587bfa9050f29
x-ntap-sg-consistency: true
Host: test.com
----

=== Response

[cols="2a,4a" options="header"]
|===
| Response HTTP Header| Description

m| Date
| The date and time of the response.

m| Connection
| Whether the connection to the server is open or closed.

m| X-Trans-Id
| The unique transaction identifier for the request.

m| Content-Length
| The length of the response body.

m| x-ntap-sg-consistency
| The consistency control level being applied to the container. The following values are supported:

*all*: All nodes receive the data immediately or the request will fail.

*strong-global*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites.

*strong-site*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.

*read-after-new-write*: (Default) Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Recommended for most cases.

*available*: Provides eventual consistency for both new objects and object updates. For S3 buckets, use only as required (for example, for a bucket that contains log values that are rarely read, or for HEAD or GET operations on keys that do not exist). Not supported for S3 FabricPool buckets.

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

Content-Length: 0
x-ntap-sg-consistency: strong-site

== PUT container consistency request

The PUT container consistency request allows you to specify the consistency level to apply to operations performed on a container. By default, new containers are created using the "`read-after-new-write`" consistency level.

=== Request

[cols="2a,4a" options="header"]
|===
| Request HTTP Header| Description

m| X-Auth-Token
| The Swift authentication token for the account to use for the request.

m| x-ntap-sg-consistency
| The consistency control level to apply to operations on the container. The following values are supported:

*all*: All nodes receive the data immediately or the request will fail.

*strong-global*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites.

*strong-site*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.

*read-after-new-write*: (Default) Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Recommended for most cases.

*available*: Provides eventual consistency for both new objects and object updates. For S3 buckets, use only as required (for example, for a bucket that contains log values that are rarely read, or for HEAD or GET operations on keys that do not exist). Not supported for S3 FabricPool buckets.

|`Host`
|The hostname to which the request is directed.

=== How consistency controls and ILM rules interact to affect data protection

Both your choice of link:../s3/consistency-controls.html[consistency control] and your ILM rule affect how objects are protected. These settings can interact.

For example, the consistency control used when an object is stored affects the initial placement of object metadata, while the link:../ilm/what-ilm-rule-is.html#ilm-rule-ingest-behavior[ingest behavior] selected for the ILM rule affects the initial placement of object copies. Because StorageGRID requires access to both an object's metadata and its data to fulfill client requests, selecting matching levels of protection for the consistency level and ingest behavior can provide better initial data protection and more predictable system responses.

=== Example of how consistency control and ILM rule can interact

Suppose you have a two-site grid with the following ILM rule and the following consistency level setting:

* *ILM rule*: Create two object copies, one at the local site and one at a remote site. The Strict ingest behavior is selected.
* *Consistency level*: "`strong-global`" (Object metadata is immediately distributed to all sites.)

When a client stores an object to the grid, StorageGRID makes both object copies and distributes metadata to both sites before returning success to the client.

The object is fully protected against loss at the time of the ingest successful message. For example, if the local site is lost shortly after ingest, copies of both the object data and the object metadata still exist at the remote site. The object is fully retrievable.

If you instead used the same ILM rule and the "`strong-site`" consistency level, the client might receive a success message after object data is replicated to the remote site but before object metadata is distributed there. In this case, the level of protection of object metadata does not match the level of protection for object data. If the local site is lost shortly after ingest, object metadata is lost. The object cannot be retrieved.

The inter-relationship between consistency levels and ILM rules can be complex. Contact NetApp if you require assistance.
