You can configure various security settings from the Grid Manager to help secure your StorageGRID system.

== Manage encryption
StorageGRID provides a number of options for encrypting data. You should link:reviewing-storagegrid-encryption-methods.html[review the available encryption methods] to determine which ones meet your data-protection requirements. 

== Manage certificates

You can link:using-storagegrid-security-certificates.html[configure and manage] the server certificates used for HTTP connections or the client certificates used to authenticate a client or user identity to the server.

== Configure key management servers

Using a link:kms-configuring.html[key management server] lets you protect StorageGRID data even if an appliance is removed from the data center. After the appliance volumes are encrypted, you cannot access any data on the appliance unless the node can communicate with the KMS.

NOTE: To use encryption key management, you must enable the *Node Encryption* setting for each appliance during installation, before the appliance is added to the grid.

== Manage proxy settings

If you are using S3 platform services or Cloud Storage Pools, you can configure a link:configuring-storage-proxy-settings.html[Storage proxy server] between Storage Nodes and the external S3 endpoints. If you send AutoSupport messages using HTTPS or HTTP, you can configure an link:configuring-admin-proxy-settings.html[Admin proxy server] between Admin Nodes and technical support.

NOTE: As of the StorageGRID 11.7 release, NetApp's AutoSupport servers will reject messages sent using HTTP. You must configure a proxy server to forward AutoSupport messages as HTTPS.

== Control firewalls

To enhance the security of your system, you can control access to StorageGRID Admin Nodes by opening or closing specific ports at the link:controlling-access-through-firewalls.html[external firewall]. You can also control network access to each node by configuring its link:manage-firewall-controls.html[internal firewall]. You can prevent access on all ports except those needed for your deployment.
