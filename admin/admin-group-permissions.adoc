[.lead]
When creating admin user groups, you select one or more permissions to control access to specific features of the Grid Manager. You can then assign each user to one or more of these admin groups to determine which tasks that user can perform.

You must assign at least one permission to each group; otherwise, users belonging to that group will not be able to sign in to the Grid Manager or the Grid Management API.

By default, any user who belongs to a group that has at least one permission can perform the following tasks:

* Sign in to the Grid Manager
* View the dashboard
* View the Nodes pages
* Monitor grid topology
* View current and resolved alerts
* View current and historical alarms (legacy system)
* Change their own password (local users only)
* View certain information about the Configuration and Maintenance pages

== Interaction between permissions and Access mode

For all permissions, the group's *Access mode* setting determines whether users can change settings and perform operations or whether they can only view the related settings and features. If a user belongs to multiple groups and any group is set to *Read-only*, the user will have read-only access to all selected settings and features.

The following sections describe the permissions you can assign when creating or editing an admin group. Any functionality not explicitly mentioned requires the *Root access* permission.

== Root access

This permission provides access to all grid administration features.

== Acknowledge alarms (legacy)

This permission provides access to acknowledge and respond to alarms (legacy system). All signed-in users can view current and historical alarms.

If you want a user to monitor grid topology and acknowledge alarms only, you should assign this permission.

== Change tenant root password

This permission provides access to the *Change root password* option on the Tenants page, allowing you to control who can change the password for the tenant's local root user. This permission is also used for migrating S3 keys when the S3 key import feature is enabled. Users who do not have this permission cannot see the *Change root password* option.

NOTE: To grant access to the Tenants page, which contains the *Change root password* option, also assign the *Tenant accounts* permission.

== Grid topology page configuration

This permission provides access to the Configuration tabs on the *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology* page.

== ILM

This permission provides access to the following *ILM* menu options:

* Rules
* Policies
* Erasure coding
* Regions
* Storage pools

NOTE: Users must have the *Other grid configuration* and *Grid topology page configuration* permissions to manage storage grades.

* *CONFIGURATION* > *Access control*:
