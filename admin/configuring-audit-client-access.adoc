[.lead]
The Admin Node, through the Audit Management System (AMS) service, logs all audited system events to a log file available through the audit share, which is added to each Admin Node at installation. The audit share is automatically enabled as a read-only share. 

To access audit logs, you can configure client access to audit shares for NFS. Or, you can link:../monitor/considerations-for-external-syslog-server.html[use an external syslog server].

The StorageGRID system uses positive acknowledgment to prevent loss of audit messages before they are written to the log file. A message remains queued at a service until the AMS service or an intermediate audit relay service has acknowledged control of it. For more information, see link:../audit/index.html[Review audit logs].


.What you'll need

* You have the `Passwords.txt` file with the root/admin password.
* You have the `Configuration.txt` file (available in the Recovery Package).
* The audit client is using NFS Version 3 (NFSv3).

.About this task

Perform this procedure for each Admin Node in a StorageGRID deployment from which you want to retrieve audit messages.

.Steps

. Log in to the primary Admin Node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_primary_Admin_Node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Confirm that all services have a state of Running or Verified. Enter: `storagegrid-status`
+
If any services aren't listed as Running or Verified, resolve issues before continuing.

. Return to the command line. Press *Ctrl*+*C*.
. Start the NFS configuration utility. Enter: `config_nfs.rb`
+

. Add the audit client: `add-audit-share`
 .. When prompted, enter the audit client's IP address or IP address range for the audit share: `client_IP_address`
 .. When prompted, press *Enter*.
. If more than one audit client is permitted to access the audit share, add the IP address of the additional user: `add-ip-to-share`
 .. Enter the number of the audit share: `_audit_share_number_`
 .. When prompted, enter the audit client's IP address or IP address range for the audit share: `_client_IP_address_`
 .. When prompted, press *Enter*.
+
The NFS configuration utility is displayed.

 .. Repeat these substeps for each additional audit client that has access to the audit share.
. Optionally, verify your configuration.
 .. Enter the following: `validate-config`
+
The services are checked and displayed.

 .. When prompted, press *Enter*.
+
The NFS configuration utility is displayed.

 .. Close the NFS configuration utility: `exit`
. Determine if you must enable audit shares at other sites.
 ** If the StorageGRID deployment is a single site, go to the next step.
 ** If the StorageGRID deployment includes Admin Nodes at other sites, enable these audit shares as required:

 .. Remotely log in to the site's Admin Node:
  ... Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
  ... Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Repeat these steps to configure the audit shares for each additional Admin Node.
 .. Close the remote secure shell login to the remote Admin Node. Enter: `exit`
. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
+
NFS audit clients are granted access to an audit share based on their IP address. Grant access to the audit share to a new NFS audit client by adding its IP address to the share, or remove an existing audit client by removing its IP address.
