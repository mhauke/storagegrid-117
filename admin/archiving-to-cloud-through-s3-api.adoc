[.lead]
You can configure an Archive Node to connect directly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or to any other system that can interface to the StorageGRID system through the S3 API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Support for Archive Nodes is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Moving objects from an Archive Node to an external archival storage system through the S3 API has been replaced by ILM Cloud Storage Pools, which offer more functionality. 

The Cloud Tiering - Simple Storage Service (S3) option is also deprecated. If you are currently using an Archive Node with this option, link:../admin/migrating-objects-from-cloud-tiering-s3-to-cloud-storage-pool.html[migrate your objects to a Cloud Storage Pool] instead.

Additionally, you should remove Archive Nodes from the active ILM policy in StorageGRID 11.7 or earlier. Removing object data stored on Archive Nodes will simplify future upgrades. See link:../ilm/working-with-ilm-rules-and-ilm-policies.html[Working with ILM rules and ILM policies].
