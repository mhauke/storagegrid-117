Security certificates are small data files used to create secure, trusted connections between StorageGRID components and between StorageGRID components and external systems.

StorageGRID uses two types of security certificates:

* *Server certificates* are required when you use HTTPS connections. Server certificates are used to establish secure connections between clients and servers, authenticating the identity of a server to its clients and providing a secure communication path for data. The server and the client each have a copy of the certificate.
* *Client certificates* authenticate a client or user identity to the server, providing more secure authentication than passwords alone. Client certificates don't encrypt data.

When a client connects to the server using HTTPS, the server responds with the server certificate, which contains a public key. The client verifies this certificate by comparing the server signature to the signature on its copy of the certificate. If the signatures match, the client starts a session with the server using the same public key.

StorageGRID functions as the server for some connections (such as the load balancer endpoint) or as the client for other connections (such as the CloudMirror replication service).

[[gridca_details]]
*Default Grid CA certificate*

StorageGRID includes a built-in certificate authority (CA) that generates an internal Grid CA certificate during system installation. The Grid CA certificate is used, by default, to secure internal StorageGRID traffic. An external certificate authority (CA) can issue custom certificates that are fully compliant with your organization's information security policies. Although you can use the Grid CA certificate for a non-production environment, the best practice for a production environment is to use custom certificates signed by an external certificate authority. Unsecured connections with no certificate are also supported but are not recommended.

* Custom CA certificates don't remove the internal certificates; however, the custom certificates should be the ones specified for verifying server connections.
* All custom certificates must meet the link:../harden/hardening-guideline-for-server-certificates.html[system hardening guidelines for server certificates].
* StorageGRID supports bundling of certificates from a CA into a single file (known as a CA certificate bundle).

NOTE: StorageGRID also includes operating system CA certificates that are the same on all grids. In production environments, make sure that you specify a custom certificate signed by an external certificate authority in place of the operating system CA certificate.

Variants of the server and client certificate types are implemented in several ways. You should have all the certificates needed for your specific StorageGRID configuration ready before you configure the system.

====

.Global
--
The global certificates secure StorageGRID access from web browsers and external S3 and Swift API clients. Two global certificates are initially generated by the StorageGRID certificate authority during installation. The best practice for a production environment is to use custom certificates signed by an external certificate authority.

* <<Management interface certificate>>: Secures client web-browser connections to StorageGRID management interfaces.
* <<S3 and Swift API certificate>>: Secures client API connections to Storage Nodes, Admin Nodes, and Gateway Nodes, which S3 and Swift client applications use to upload and download object data.

Information about the global certificates that are installed includes:

* *Name*: Certificate name with link to managing the certificate.
* *Description*
* *Type*: Custom or default. +
You should always use a custom certificate for improved grid security.
* *Expiration date*: If using the default certificate, no expiration date is shown.

You can:

* Replace the default certificates with custom certificates signed by an external certificate authority for improved grid security:

== Certificate examples

=== Example 1: Load Balancer service

In this example, StorageGRID acts as the server.

. You configure a load balancer endpoint and upload or generate a server certificate in StorageGRID.
. You configure an S3 or Swift client connection to the load balancer endpoint and upload the same certificate to the client.
. When the client wants to save or retrieve data, it connects to the load balancer endpoint using HTTPS.
. StorageGRID responds with the server certificate, which contains a public key, and with a signature based on the private key.
. The client verifies this certificate by comparing the server signature to the signature on its copy of the certificate. If the signatures match, the client starts a session using the same public key.
. The client sends object data to StorageGRID.

=== Example 2: External key management server (KMS)

In this example, StorageGRID acts as the client.

. Using external Key Management Server software, you configure StorageGRID as a KMS client and obtain a CA-signed server certificate, a public client certificate, and the private key for the client certificate.
. Using the Grid Manager, you configure a KMS server and upload the server and client certificates and the client private key.
. When a StorageGRID node needs an encryption key, it makes a request to the KMS server that includes data from the certificate and a signature based on the private key.
. The KMS server validates the certificate signature and decides that it can trust StorageGRID.
. The KMS server responds using the validated connection.
