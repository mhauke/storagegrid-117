[.lead]
After recovering storage volumes for a non-appliance Storage Node, you can restore the replicated or erasure-coded object data that was lost when the Storage Node failed.

== Which procedure should I use?

Whenever possible, restore object data using the *Volume restoration* page in the Grid Manager.

* If the volumes are listed at *MAINTENANCE* > *Volume restoration* > *Nodes to restore*, restore object data using the link:../maintain/restoring-volume.html[Volume restoration page in the Grid Manager].

* If the volumes are not listed at *MAINTENANCE* > *Volume restoration* > *Nodes to restore*, follow the steps below for using the `repair-data` script to restore object data.
+
If the recovered Storage Node contains fewer volumes than the node it is replacing, you must use the `repair-data` script.

== Use the `repair-data` script to restore object data

include::../_include/restore-data-repair.adoc[]

== Monitor repairs
Monitor the status of the repair jobs, based on whether you use *replicated data*, *erasure-coded (EC) data*, or both.

You can also monitor the status of volume restoration jobs in process and view a history of restoration jobs completed in
