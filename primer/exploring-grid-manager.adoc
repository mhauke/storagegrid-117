[.lead]
The Grid Manager is the browser-based graphical interface that allows you to configure, manage, and monitor your StorageGRID system.

When you sign in to the Grid Manager, you are connecting to an Admin Node. Each StorageGRID system includes one primary Admin Node and any number of non-primary Admin Nodes. You can connect to any Admin Node, and each Admin Node displays a similar view of the StorageGRID system.

You can access the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].

== Grid Manager dashboard

When you first sign in to the Grid Manager, you can use the dashboard to monitor system activities at a glance.

The dashboard contains information about system health and performance, storage use, ILM processes, S3 and Swift operations, and the nodes in the grid. You can configure the dashboard by selecting from a collection of cards that contain the information you need to effectively monitor your system.

For an explanation of the information on each card, select the help icon image:../media/icon_nms_question.png[question mark icon] for that card.

== Search field

The *Search* field in the header bar allows you to quickly navigate to a specific page within Grid Manager. For example, you can enter *km* to access the Key management server (KMS) page. You can use *Search* to find entries in the sidebar of the Grid Manager and on the Configuration, Maintenance, and Support menus. 

== Help menu

The help menu image:../media/icon-help-menu-bar.png[help icon on the menu bar] provides access to the FabricPool and S3 setup wizard, the StorageGRID documentation center for the current release, and the API documentation. You can also determine which version of StorageGRID is currently installed.

== Alerts menu

The Alerts menu provides an easy-to-use interface for detecting, evaluating, and resolving issues that might occur during StorageGRID operation.

image::../media/alerts_menu.png[Alerts Menu]

From the Alerts menu, you can do the following:

* Review current alerts
* Review resolved alerts
* Configure silences to suppress alert notifications
* Define alert rules for conditions that trigger alerts
* Configure the email server for alert notifications

== Nodes page

The Nodes page displays information about the entire grid, each site in the grid, and each node at a site.

The Nodes home page displays combined metrics for the entire grid. To view information for a particular site or node, select the site or node.

== Tenants page

The Tenants page allows you to create and monitor the storage tenant accounts for your StorageGRID system. You must create at least one tenant account to specify who can store and retrieve objects and which functionality is available to them.

The Tenants page also provides usage details for each tenant, including the amount of storage used and the number of objects. If you set a quota when you created the tenant, you can see how much of that quota has been used.

== ILM menu

The ILM menu allows you to configure the information lifecycle management (ILM) rules and policies that govern data durability and availability. You can also enter an object identifier to view the metadata for that object.
