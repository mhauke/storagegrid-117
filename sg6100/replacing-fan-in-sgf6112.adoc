The SGF6112 appliance has eight cooling fans. If one of the fans fails, you must replace it as soon as possible to ensure that the appliance has proper cooling.

.What you'll need

* You have the correct replacement fan.
* You have determined the location of the fan to replace.

* You have confirmed that the other fans are installed and running.

.About this task
To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before starting the fan replacement or replace the fan during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are normally expected. See the information about link:../monitor/monitoring-system-health.html#monitor-node-connection-states[monitoring node connection states].

IMPORTANT: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object, you must replace the fan during a scheduled maintenance window. Otherwise, you might temporarily lose access to those objects during this procedure. See information about link:../ilm/why-you-should-not-use-single-copy-replication.html[why you should not use single-copy replication].

The appliance node will not be accessible while you replace the fan.

The photograph shows a fan for the appliance. The electrical connector is highlighted. The cooling fans are accessible after you take the top cover off of the appliance.

NOTE: Each of the two power supply units also contain a fan. The power supply fans aren't included in this procedure.
