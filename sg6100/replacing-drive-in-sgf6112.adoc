The SGF6112 storage appliance contains 12 SSD drives. The drives are mirrored using RAID for redundancy. If one of the drives fails, you must replace it as soon as possible to ensure redundancy.

.What you'll need

* You have link:locating-sgf6112-in-data-center.html[physically located the appliance].

* You have verified which drive has failed by noting that the drive's left LED is solid amber or using the Grid Manager to link:verify-component-to-replace.html[view the alert caused by the failed drive].

+
IMPORTANT: See the information about viewing status indicators to verify the failure.

* You have obtained the replacement drive.
* You have obtained proper ESD protection.

.Steps

. Verify that the drive's left LED is amber or use the drive slot ID from the alert to locate the drive.
+
The twelve drives are in the following positions in the chassis (front of chassis with bezel removed shown):

You can also use the Grid Manager to monitor the status of the SSD drives. Select *NODES*. Then select `*Storage Node*` > *Hardware*. If a drive has failed, the Storage RAID Mode field contains a message about which drive has failed.

. Wrap the strap end of the ESD wristband around your wrist, and secure the clip end to a metal ground to prevent static discharge.
. Unpack the replacement drive, and set it on a static-free, level surface near the appliance.
+
Save all packing materials.

. Press the release button on the failed drive.

The handle on the drive springs open partially, and the drive releases from the slot.

. Open the handle, slide the drive out, and place it on a static-free, level surface.
. Press the release button on the replacement drive before you insert it into the drive slot.

. Insert the replacement drive in the slot, and then close the drive handle.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not use excessive force while closing the handle.
+
When the drive is fully inserted, you hear a click.
+
The replaced drive is automatically rebuilt with mirrored data from the working drives. The drive LED should blink initially, but then stop blinking as soon as the system determines that the drive has enough capacity and is functional.

+ 
You can check the status of the rebuild by using the Grid Manager.

. If more than one drive failed and has been replaced, you might have alerts indicating that some volumes need to have data restored to them. If you receive an alert, before attempting volume recovery, select *NODES* > `*appliance Storage Node*` > *Hardware*. In the StorageGRID Appliance section of the page, verify that the Storage RAID mode is healthy or rebuilding. If the status lists one or more failed drives, correct this condition before attempting volume restoration. 

. In the Grid Manager, go to *NODES* > `*appliance Storage Node*` > *Hardware*. In the StorageGRID Appliance section of the page, verify that the Storage RAID mode is healthy.
