When configuring StorageGRID for use with FabricPool, you can optionally create one or more high availability (HA) groups.
An HA group is a collection of nodes that each contain the StorageGRID Load Balancer service. An HA group can contain Gateway Nodes, Admin Nodes, or both.

You can use an HA group to help keep FabricPool data connections available. An HA group uses virtual IP addresses (VIPs) to provide highly available access to the Load Balancer service. If the active interface in the HA group fails, a backup interface can manage the workload with little impact to FabricPool operations. 

For details about this task, see link:../admin/managing-high-availability-groups.html[Manage high availability groups]. To use the FabricPool setup wizard to complete this task, go to link:use-fabricpool-setup-wizard-steps.html[Access and complete the FabricPool setup wizard].

.Before you begin
* You have reviewed the link:best-practices-for-high-availability-groups.html[best practices for high availability groups].
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access permission.
* If you plan to use a VLAN, you have created the VLAN interface. See link:../admin/configure-vlan-interfaces.html[Configure VLAN interfaces].

.Steps
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *High availability groups*.
. Select *Create*.
. For the *Enter details* step, complete the following fields.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Field| Description

|HA group name
|A unique display name for this HA group.

|Description (optional)
|The description of this HA group.

|===

. For the *Add interfaces* step, select the node interfaces you want to use in this HA group.
+
Use the column headers to sort the rows, or enter a search term to locate interfaces more quickly.
+ 
You can select one or more nodes, but you can select only one interface for each node.

. For the *Prioritize interfaces* step, determine the Primary interface and any backup interfaces for this HA group.
+
Drag rows to change the values in the *Priority order* column.
+
The first interface in the list is the Primary interface. The Primary interface is the active interface unless a failure occurs.
+
If the HA group includes more than one interface and the active interface fails, the virtual IP (VIP) addresses move to the first backup interface in the priority order. If that interface fails, the VIP addresses move to the next backup interface, and so on. When failures are resolved, the VIP addresses move back to highest priority interface available.

. For the *Enter IP addresses* step, complete the following fields.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Field| Description

|Subnet CIDR
|The address of the VIP subnet in CIDR notation&#8212;an IPv4 address followed by a slash and the subnet length (0-32). 

The network address must not have any host bits set. For example, `192.16.0.0/22`.

|Gateway IP address (optional)
|Optional. If the ONTAP IP addresses used to access StorageGRID aren't on the same subnet as the StorageGRID VIP addresses, enter the StorageGRID VIP local gateway IP address. The local gateway IP address must be within the VIP subnet.

|Virtual IP address
|Enter at least one and no more than ten VIP addresses for the active interface in the HA group. All VIP addresses must be within the VIP subnet.

At least one address must be IPv4. Optionally, you can specify additional IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

. Select *Create HA group* and then select *Finish*.
